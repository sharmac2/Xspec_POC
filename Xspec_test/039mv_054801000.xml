          <text>Before bringing an action for damages for personal injury arising out of a motor
            vehicle accident where the motor vehicle cannot be identified, by s 37(2)(a) of the
            Motor Accident Insurance Act 1994 (Qld), the claimant must notify the nominal defendant
            within 3 months after the accident. By s 37(3) if notice of a motor vehicle claim is not
            given within the time fixed by this section, the obligation to give the notice continues
            and &#x201C;a reasonable excuse&#x201D; for the delay must be given in the notice or by
            separate notice to the insurer but, if a motor vehicle cannot be identified and the
            notice is not given to the nominal defendant within 9 months after the motor vehicle
            accident, the claim against the nominal defendant is barred.</text>

            carpenter, claimed that on 16 April 2002, he was injured in an accident involving an
            unidentified motor vehicle. While in hospital, on 23 April 2002, he applied for
            workers&#x2019; compensation. In May 2002 he discussed the possibility of a common law
            claim against his employer with his uncle and an industrial advocate. Not until August
            2002 did he discuss the possibility of a claim against the nominal defendant. Not until
            then did he realise that the industrial advocate was not a lawyer. After further delays
            a solicitor was engaged. On 4 October 2002 a notice of claim was received by the nominal
            defendant explaining the delay. The notice was received within 9 months after the
            accident. The primary judge held that Piper had &#x201C;a reasonable excuse for the
            delay&#x201D; to commence proceedings. The nominal defendant appealed.</text>

            accident. He advised her that notice should be given <page count="549" reporter="mvr"

            10 April 2003 new solicitors explained that the cause of the delay was the negligence of
            Perdis&#x2019;s former solicitor. The primary judge concluded that Perdis&#x2019;s own
            personal actions were reasonably excusable. The nominal defendant appealed.</text>

            a limited knowledge of English, claimed that on 18 February 2002 he was injured when
            driving a bus in the the course of his employment and had to take avoiding action to
            avoid colliding with an unidentified vehicle at an intersection. On 19 February 2002 he
            claimed workers&#x2019; compensation. On 23 May 2002 he consulted a solicitor to discuss
            the cessation of his WorkCover benefits. The solicitor suggested he fill out a form of
            notice required by s 37. The notice was received by the nominal defendant on 11 July
            2002, nearly 5 months after the accident. No explanation was given for the delay between
            18 May 2002 and 23 May 2002. The primary judge concluded that the failure to give a
            reasonable excuse for the delay from 23 May was the fault of the solicitor. The
            application by Miller was filed on 18 November 2002 and heard by him on 13 December
            2002. The primary judge held that even though the notice of claim must be given within
            9 months a reasonable excuse for delay may be given at any time. He authorised Miller to
            bring further proceedings. The nominal defendant appealed. </text>

                <text>On 18 December 2002 the appellant applied in the Supreme Court for a
                  declaration pursuant to s 39 of the Motor Accident Insurance Act 1994 (Qld) (the
                  Act) that the appellant has remedied the non-compliance referred to in that
                  section or an order pursuant to that section authorising the appellant to proceed
                  further despite that non-compliance. In the further alternative the appellant
                  sought a declaration that a notice dated 3 October 2002 was a complying notice
                  pursuant to s 37 of the Act and in the further alternative a declaration that the
                  complainant had provided reasonable excuse for the delay. The nominal <page

                <text>The relevant facts were as follows. The appellant, to whom I shall refer
                  hereafter as the claimant, was injured in an accident involving an unidentified
                  motor vehicle on 16 April 2002. He was admitted to the Townsville General Hospital
                  where he remained for a few days. While there his sister suggested that he apply
                  for workers&#x2019; compensation and he submitted an application for
                  workers&#x2019; compensation on 23 April 2002.</text>

                <pnum count="4">[4]</pnum>
                <text>In the meantime, on 17 April he was visited by his uncle Mr Barnard who
                  suggested that he should seek legal advice. Mr Barnard suggested that he should
                  see a good friend of his Mr James O&#x2019;Donnell. Mr O&#x2019;Donnell was an
                  industrial advocate but Mr Barnard did not tell the claimant that. Nor did he tell
                  the claimant that Mr O&#x2019;Donnell was not a lawyer. <fnr

                <text>The claimant had some difficulty in making contact with Mr O&#x2019;Donnell
                  but eventually did so and on 4 May 2002 Mr O&#x2019;Donnell visited the claimant
                  at his home accompanied by Mr Gregory Lynham, a barrister. The claimant said in
                  evidence that Mr O&#x2019;Donnell introduced Mr Lynham as a barrister. Mr Lynham
                  said in his evidence that he could not recall whether or not he was introduced as
                  a barrister but that may have been the case. Mr O&#x2019;Donnell did not give
                  evidence.</text>
              </p>
              <p>
                <pnum count="6">[6]</pnum>
                <text>Mr O&#x2019;Donnell did not say that he was a lawyer or that he was an
                  industrial advocate. However, he discussed the claimant&#x2019;s WorkCover claim
                  with him, advised him on the steps involved in the process, said that he thought
                  that the claimant had a good case and said that he was prepared to take it on.
                  During the course of that discussion, according to Mr Lynham, Mr O&#x2019;Donnell
                  mentioned the option of pursuing a common law claim against the employer. No
                  mention was made of any claim based on negligence of the driver of the
                  unidentified vehicle. However, Mr Lynham recalls mention being made, presumably by
                  the claimant, of the facts that the woman driver of the car which collided with
                  the claimant left <page count="551" reporter="mvr" text="39 MVR 548 at "
                    subdoc="true"/> the scene of the accident and that her car&#x2019;s registration
                  number appeared to have been wrongly recorded. Mr Lynham did not take part in the
                  interview between the claimant and Mr O&#x2019;Donnell but remained present
                  throughout.</text>

                <text>On 24 May Mr O&#x2019;Donnell again visited the claimant, again accompanied by
                  Mr Lynham. There was further discussion between Mr O&#x2019;Donnell and the
                  claimant about his WorkCover claim. Again Mr O&#x2019;Donnell gave advice and
                  again mentioned the possibility of a common law claim against the
                  claimant&#x2019;s employer. Her Honour found that, at that meeting, there was some
                  discussion of bringing a claim against the driver and/or the insurer of the other
                  vehicle, and of the need to identify the vehicle or its driver. Again Mr Lynham
                  remained present during the whole of the meeting between the claimant and
                  Mr O&#x2019;Donnell but did not take part in any discussion between them.</text>

                <text>It seems that the next contact between the claimant and Mr O&#x2019;Donnell
                  was in August 2002 when the claimant phoned Mr O&#x2019;Donnell. Her Honour found
                  that, in the meantime, the claimant had made attempts to phone Mr O&#x2019;Donnell
                  on his mobile but had been unsuccessful in doing so. Mr O&#x2019;Donnell then
                  arranged for Mr Lynham to give the claimant some advice, because, according to
                  Mr Lynham, Mr O&#x2019;Donnell told him he was unsure how to progress the matter.
                  At a meeting in Mr Lynham&#x2019;s chambers in early September, attended by the
                  claimant, his sister and Mr O&#x2019;Donnell, Mr Lynham explained to the claimant,
                  for the first time, the possibility of a claim against the nominal defendant. He
                  told him that the period of 3 months stated in s 37(2)(a) had expired (it had
                  expired on 16 July) and that he would need to explain now why he had not notified
                  the nominal defendant earlier. He showed the claimant a copy of s 37.</text>
              </p>
              <p>
                <pnum count="9">[9]</pnum>
                <text>Mr O&#x2019;Donnell then said that he would arrange for a solicitor who he
                  knew, Mr O&#x2019;Toole, to see the claimant. The claimant says that that was the
                  first time he realised that Mr O&#x2019;Donnell was not a solicitor. As it turned
                  out Mr O&#x2019;Toole was not available, apparently because of a personal family
                  matter. A further meeting took place in Mr Lynham&#x2019;s chambers where it was
                  agreed that Giudes &amp; Elliott would be contacted. The claimant then saw
                  Mr Giudes of that firm, a notice was sent on 3 October 2002 and was received by
                  the nominal defendant on 4 October.</text>

                <p>
                  <text>I was in Townsville General Hospital a few days after the accident when my
                    uncle visited me. He told me I should see James O&#x2019;Donnell who I thought
                    was a Lawyer about taking a personal injuries claim.</text>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <text>James O&#x2019;Donnell came to see me with a Barrister and I gave them full
                    particulars of the accident. I am a carpenter by trade and new [sic] nothing
                    about time limits. I thought my action was being looked after for me.</text>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <text>I rang James O&#x2019;Donnell on several occasions and about 6 weeks later
                    he came to my home with the Barrister but not with the paperwork he had promised
                    he would bring for me to sign. We just talked again about the accident.</text>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <text>I tried to contact James O&#x2019;Donnell on several further occasions on
                    his mobile telephone but only my uncle was successful in contacting him.</text>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <text>About 3 weeks ago, we saw James O&#x2019;Donnell in a Barrister&#x2019;s
                    Chambers in Townsville when he told us he was an Industrial Advocate and not a
                    Lawyer. The Barrister said we would have to hurry things along because of the
                    time restraints and that I would have to write a letter explaining why we were
                    slightly late. James O&#x2019;Donnell said he would organise a Solicitor to see
                    me.</text>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <text>I went to see that Solicitor in the Barrister&#x2019;s Chambers last
                    Saturday, 28 September 2002 when the Barrister and James O&#x2019;Donnell were
                    present but not the Solicitor, who was unavailable apparently due to a family
                    crisis.</text>

                <p>
                  <text>James O&#x2019;Donnell was supposed to organise for me to see this Solicitor
                    on Wednesday, 2 October last but it never occurred. Subsequently, we saw our
                    Solicitor, Raoul Giudes from Giudes &amp; Elliott on Thursday, 3 October
                    2002.</text>

                <text>The principal question in those circumstances is whether what occurred between
                  16 July 2002 and 4 October 2002 provided a reasonable excuse for the
                  claimant&#x2019;s delay in giving notice of a claim until that latter date. The
                  learned primary judge held that it did not. She reached that conclusion by
                  answering in the negative the following question: was it reasonable for the
                  claimant to assume that Mr O&#x2019;Donnell was a lawyer? In my opinion her Honour
                  was correct in thinking that that was a correct question to ask.</text>

                  contemporaneously with these reasons) this court held that &#x201C;a reasonable
                  excuse for the delay&#x201D; has been given within the meaning of s 37(3) of the
                  Act where the excuse was that the claimant retained and gave adequate instructions
                  to a solicitor, in sufficient time before the expiry of the 3 months stated in
                  s 37(2)(a), to enable him or her to prepare and send a notice containing or
                  accompanied by a reasonable excuse for the delay. It so held because in doing so,
                  such a claimant had done what a reasonable person might have been expected to do
                  namely leave the matter then in the hands of an apparently competent solicitor.
                  The court referred to one possible qualification to this principle, not relevant
                  in that case and not relevant, I think, in this. That is if, after the claimant
                  has entrusted the matter to his or her solicitor, there was some reason which
                  ought to have caused a reasonable person in the position of the claimant to take
                  further action, such as to make inquiry as to the progress of the claim, and the
                  claimant failed to take that action.</text>

                <text>In the present case the claimant assumed that Mr O&#x2019;Donnell was a
                  solicitor competent to act on his behalf. Was he reasonable in thinking that? Her
                  Honour thought that he was not because she thought that he had an interest in
                  knowing what his legal position was and that he ought to have clarified
                  Mr O&#x2019;Donnell&#x2019;s status, at least at the second meeting when he was
                  advised against pursuing WorkCover and a common law claim was suggested.</text>

                <text>Her Honour had earlier said that whether an excuse is a reasonable one is to
                  be judged objectively in all the circumstances. Those circumstances included, her
                  Honour thought, the claimant&#x2019;s personal characteristics such as his age,
                  intelligence and education, the nature of the injuries sustained, and the
                  likelihood of prejudice to the nominal defendant. Subject to the question whether
                  the likelihood of prejudice to the nominal defendant is relevant to this question

                  what her Honour said in this respect. Her Honour went on to describe the claimant
                  as a labourer (he described himself as a carpenter but that does not weaken the
                  force of her Honour&#x2019;s following impression) and someone who impressed her

                <text>With some hesitation, I disagree with her Honour&#x2019;s conclusion that, on
                  the facts accepted by her Honour, the claimant did not have a reasonable excuse
                  for his delay in giving the notice required under s 37. That is primarily because,
                  in my opinion, the claimant acted reasonably in thinking that Mr O&#x2019;Donnell
                  was a lawyer to whom he had entrusted the making of a claim in respect of his
                  injuries <page count="553" reporter="mvr" text="39 MVR 548 at " subdoc="true"/>
                  against whomsoever such a claim could properly be made; and that thereafter he
                  acted reasonably until 4 October when the notice of claim of accident was
                  given.</text>

                <text>Like her Honour I think that the question of reasonableness must be considered
                  objectively but having regard to the claimant&#x2019;s personal characteristics
                  such as his age, intelligence and education. He was of limited education with
                  little understanding of legal matters.</text>

                <text>Mr O&#x2019;Donnell came to see the claimant in circumstances in which the
                  claimant&#x2019;s uncle had told him that he would send Mr O&#x2019;Donnell to him
                  because he needed legal advice. The advice which Mr O&#x2019;Donnell gave, on the
                  first and on the second meeting was plainly legal advice. Moreover on each
                  occasion he was accompanied by a person whom he introduced as a barrister and who
                  remained present throughout the interview between them.</text>

                <text>In those circumstances the claimant was, in my opinion, entitled to assume
                  that Mr O&#x2019;Donnell was a solicitor to whom he was entrusting whatever claim
                  he had for his injuries in the accident. Unlike her Honour I do not think it was
                  unreasonable of him not, on either occasion, to ask specifically whether
                  Mr O&#x2019;Donnell was a solicitor.</text>

                <text>It was not until sometime in early September, at the meeting in
                  Mr Lynham&#x2019;s chambers, that the claimant learnt, for the first time, that
                  Mr O&#x2019;Donnell was not a solicitor. The 3 month period required by s 37(2)(a)
                  had expired, as I indicated earlier, on 16 July.</text>

                <text>Perhaps things could have moved more quickly than they did from early
                  September to early October but this seems to have been because Mr O&#x2019;Donnell
                  and, later, Mr Lynham had undertaken to engage a solicitor on the
                  claimant&#x2019;s behalf and because of Mr O&#x2019;Tooles&#x2019; apparently
                  sudden unavailability. I do not think that, during that period, there was any more
                  that the claimant, given his age and apparent lack of sophistication, should
                  reasonably have done to shorten that delay or that that delay was significant. The
                  nominal defendant does not appear to contend to the contrary.</text>

                <pnum count="21">[21]</pnum>
                <text>It follows that I think that her Honour erred in concluding that the claimant
                  did not have reasonable excuse for the delay until 4 October 2002 and that he did
                  not then give reasonable excuse for the delay. Two further questions remain for
                  consideration. The first is whether, reasonable excuse having been given for the
                  delay from 16 July 2002 until 4 October 2002, an order should have been made
                  pursuant to s 39(5)(c). And the second is, if an order should have been made,
                  whether it should have been pursuant to s 39(5)(c)(i) or (ii).</text>

                <pnum count="22">[22]</pnum>
                <text>I think it was appropriate to make such an order. The claimant has given a
                  reasonable excuse for the delay. The circumstances of the claimant&#x2019;s
                  accident, as outlined in the police traffic accident report, show that the
                  claimant had good prospects of proving that the unidentified motor vehicle was
                  primarily to blame for the accident and his injuries. And the nominal defendant
                  has not asserted any prejudice from the delay.</text>

                month period, and also a reasonable explanation for the delay thereafter.</text>

              <text>The learned judge at first instance said:</text>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                <text>Whether an excuse is a reasonable one is to be judged objectively in all the
                  circumstances. Those circumstances include the claimant&#x2019;s personal
                  characteristics such as his age, intelligence, and education, the nature of the
                  injuries sustained, and the likelihood of prejudice to the Nominal
                  Defendant.</text>

            </blockquote>
            <p>
              <pnum count="30">[30]</pnum>
              <text>I agree that the test must be an objective one, and in a case such as this the
                age, intelligence and education of the claimant will always be significant. The
                appellant was born on 28 November 1971, making him 30 at the time of the accident,
                and nearly 31 when the notice was ultimately given. He is a carpenter by trade. In
                his statement purporting to establish reasonable excuse he claimed that he knew
                nothing about time limits. The judge at first instance had the opportunity of
                assessing the appellant while he gave evidence and she recorded that he was
                &#x201C;&#x2026; someone who impressed me as having little if any understanding of
                legal matters, let alone the intricacies of the &#x2026; Act&#x201D;.</text>

            <p>
              <pnum count="31">[31]</pnum>
              <text>The main reason for the learned judge at first instance concluding the appellant
                had not given a reasonable excuse for the delay was that the appellant assumed that
                O&#x2019;Donnell was a lawyer which was not, in all the circumstances, a reasonable
                assumption.</text>

              <text>I will not set out in these reasons a summary of the meetings between the
                appellant and O&#x2019;Donnell on 4 May, 24 May and &#x201C;early September&#x201D;
                2002; I am content to accept the summary contained in the reasons for judgment of
                Davies JA.</text>

            <p>
              <pnum count="33">[33]</pnum>
              <text>Under cross-examination at first instance the appellant said for the first time
                that his uncle, Ron Barnard, described O&#x2019;Donnell before the first meeting as
                &#x201C;a good lawyer&#x201D;. The learned judge did not accept that the uncle so
                described O&#x2019;Donnell, and there was no challenge to that finding on the
                hearing of the appeal. The fact that such an assertion was made for the first time
                when the appellant was under cross-examination was clearly a sufficient reason for
                rejecting his evidence in that regard.</text>
            </p>
            <p>
              <pnum count="34">[34]</pnum>
              <text>Also under cross-examination the appellant admitted that at the initial meeting
                nothing was said to the effect that O&#x2019;Donnell was a lawyer or a solicitor or
                a barrister. Under further questioning it became clear that the appellant made an
                assumption to that effect. In answering a relevant question he used the words
                &#x201C;I assumed he was one &#x2026;&#x201D;. When asked what was the basis for
                that assumption he answered: &#x201C;Well, he brought a barrister out with him for
                starters out to my house and introduced him as a barrister. Then on the second
                meeting he told me that the &#x2014; WorkCover wasn&#x2019;t the way to go, a common
                law claim was the way to go.&#x201D;</text>

            <p>
              <pnum count="35">[35]</pnum>
              <text>Those matters were dealt with in the reasons for judgment at first instance as
                follows:</text>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                <text>There is no evidence that Mr O&#x2019;Donnell ever described himself as a
                  lawyer. There is no evidence that Mr O&#x2019;Donnell or Mr Lynham did anything at
                  either of the first two meetings to suggest that Mr Lynham would be involved in
                  the case in any way. I am prepared to accept that Mr O&#x2019;Donnell gave the
                  impression he would look after the <page count="556" reporter="mvr"
                    text="39 MVR 548 at " subdoc="true"/> WorkCover claim. Further, I accept that at
                  the second meeting Mr O&#x2019;Donnell told the appellant that WorkCover was
                  &#x201C;not the way to go&#x201D;, that there was some discussion of a
                  &#x201C;common law claim&#x201D;, and that Mr O&#x2019;Donnell said he would make
                  inquiries to try to ascertain the identity of the other vehicle or its
                  driver.</text>
              </p>
              <p>
                <text>However, I do not accept that the applicant&#x2019;s uncle said that
                  Mr O&#x2019;Donnell was a lawyer. At most the applicant assumed that he was. In my
                  view that was not a reasonable assumption. The applicant had an interest in
                  knowing what his legal position was, and he ought to have clarified
                  Mr O&#x2019;Donnell&#x2019;s status, at least at the second meeting when he was
                  advised against pursuing WorkCover and a common law claim was suggested.</text>
              </p>
              <p>
                <text>There is no evidence from Mr O&#x2019;Donnell explaining his role in advising
                  the applicant and why he did not give the respondent notice of the
                  accident.</text>
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              <pnum count="36">[36]</pnum>
              <text>All of those conclusions were, in my view, clearly open on the evidence and I am
                not persuaded that the learned judge was wrong in reaching them.</text>
            </p>
            <p>
              <pnum count="37">[37]</pnum>
              <text>At the material time the appellant was a mature man of 30 years of age though
                with limited knowledge of legal matters. He clearly recognised that it was important
                for him to take legal advice and the vital question really is whether or not he took
                reasonable steps to obtain such advice. In my view having informal discussions with
                O&#x2019;Donnell and others in the way that he did it did not constitute taking
                reasonable steps to obtain legal advice as to his position. Certainly once he was
                advised that a common law claim should be made he should have taken steps to ensure
                that he was given adequate legal advice with respect thereto. A reasonable person in
                the position of the appellant would have done so.</text>

              <text>The essential facts in this matter are set out in detail in the reasons for
                judgment of Davies JA and summarised in the reasons for judgment of Williams JA. I
                will therefore not repeat them except to the extent necessary for elaborating upon
                the issues. There is an appeal against the finding by the learned trial judge that
                the appellant had not provided a reasonable excuse for the delay in providing a
                notice to the respondent under s 37(4) of the Motor Accident Insurance Act 1994
                (Qld) and other associated grounds. There was also a notice of contention on behalf
                of the respondent premised on the proposition that not only did the applicant have
                to give a reasonable excuse for his own conduct, but also for that of any person
                acting on his behalf. For reasons given in <ci:cite searchtype="CASE-REF"

                    /></ci:content></ci:cite> I am of the view that the appellant&#x2019;s conduct
                from the date of the accident to the date upon which the notice of claim was filed
                may be reviewed for the purpose of determining whether a reasonable excuse has been
                given. The accident occurred on 16 April 2002. The 3 month period therefore expired
                on 16 July 2002. The notice of claim was received by the respondent on 4 October
                2003 [sic].</text>

            <p>
              <pnum count="43">[43]</pnum>
              <text>The excuse advanced was that the appellant believed that Mr O&#x2019;Donnell,
                whom he was advised to see by his uncle in connection with his accident, was a <page
                  count="557" reporter="mvr" text="39 MVR 548 at " subdoc="true"/> lawyer. In fact
                Mr O&#x2019;Donnell was an industrial advocate. There was also evidence that a
                barrister, Mr Lynham was present at times when Mr O&#x2019;Donnell spoke to the
                appellant in this connection. According to Mr Lynham he merely drove
                Mr O&#x2019;Donnell to his meetings with the appellant as a favour and did not
                participate in those discussions, at least in the first two meetings. However, in
                early September there was a meeting with the appellant in Mr Lynham&#x2019;s
                chambers at which Mr O&#x2019;Donnell was also present. On that occasion Mr Lynham
                advised the appellant of the requirements of the Act, including the fact that he
                would need to explain to the nominal defendant why more than 3 months had expired.
                He advised him to see a solicitor. Mr O&#x2019;Donnell suggested the name of a
                solicitor, but on the last Saturday in September a further meeting was organised at
                Mr Lynham&#x2019;s chambers because contact with the solicitor had not eventuated.
                Another solicitor&#x2019;s name was suggested and that solicitor acted promptly to
                give the notice.</text>

            <p>
              <pnum count="44">[44]</pnum>
              <text>The learned trial judge heard oral evidence from the appellant and Mr Lynham,
                which supplemented the affidavit evidence. Mr O&#x2019;Donnell neither gave an
                affidavit nor gave evidence. Those findings were based on the following summary of
                the effect of the evidence on the subject:</text>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                <text>In his statutory declaration the applicant said he thought Mr O&#x2019;Donnell
                  was a lawyer. His uncle advised him to get legal advice, and suggested he see
                  Mr O&#x2019;Donnell. It is not clear from the uncle&#x2019;s statutory declaration
                  whether he described Mr O&#x2019;Donnell as an industrial advocate: at any rate,
                  it is unlikely that the applicant would have known what that meant. In his oral
                  evidence the applicant said at one stage that his uncle described him as a lawyer.
                  If that were so, one wonders why such an important fact was left out of the
                  applicant&#x2019;s statutory declaration. Later, when he was questioned about why
                  he had said in the statutory declaration that he assumed Mr O&#x2019;Donnell was a
                  lawyer, he did not say that his uncle had said so &#x2014; rather, he relied on
                  the facts that a barrister had come with Mr O&#x2019;Donnell and that they had
                  discussed matters.</text>

              <pnum count="45">[45]</pnum>
              <text>The learned trial judge made a number of critical findings of fact. They are as
                follows:</text>
            </p>
            <blockquote>

                  impression he would look after the WorkCover claim. Further, I accept that at the
                  second meeting Mr O&#x2019;Donnell told the applicant that WorkCover was
                  &#x201C;not the way to go&#x201D;, that there was some discussion of a
                  &#x201C;common law claim&#x201D;, and that Mr O&#x2019;Donnell said he would make

              <pnum count="46">[46]</pnum>
              <text>The learned trial judge said that whether an excuse is a reasonable one is to be
                judged objectively in all the circumstances. Those circumstances include the
                claimant&#x2019;s personal characteristics, such as his age, intelligence and
                education, the nature of the injuries sustained, and the likelihood of prejudice to
                the nominal defendant. I agree with that formulation except to the extent that in my
                view the likelihood of prejudice to the nominal defendant is not relevant in
                determining whether an excuse is a reasonable one. It may be relevant, however, to
                the exercise of discretion under s 39(5)(c). She said that the question was <page
                  count="558" reporter="mvr" text="39 MVR 548 at " subdoc="true"/> whether it was
                reasonable for the appellant to leave the matter in Mr O&#x2019;Donnell&#x2019;s
                hands. She posed the questions whether the appellant knew that Mr O&#x2019;Donnell
                was not a lawyer and whether it was reasonable for him to assume that he was.</text>

                <text>This is an application for leave to appeal by the nominal defendant against a
                  declaration made in the District Court that the respondent had given reasonable
                  excuse to the nominal defendant, as required by s 37(3) of the Motor Accident
                  Insurance Act 1994 (Qld) (the Act), in respect of the failure by the respondent to
                  give, within 3 months of a motor vehicle accident on 6 September 2002, a written
                  notice of her accident claim to the nominal defendant. The sole question which
                  arises in the appeal if leave is granted, as identified by Mr Wilson SC for the
                  nominal defendant, is whether, in deciding whether a reasonable excuse has been
                  provided within the meaning of s 37(3), it is necessary to consider only whether
                  the claimant&#x2019;s own personal actions were reasonably excusable in the light
                  of what has occurred, or whether, in circumstances where the claimant retained a
                  solicitor in connection with the giving of the notice, it is also necessary for
                  the actions of the solicitor, in so far as they contributed to the delay, to be
                  reasonably excusable. That question arose before the learned primary judge and his
                  Honour concluded that, in deciding that question, it was necessary to consider
                  only whether the claimant&#x2019;s own personal actions were reasonably excusable.
                  He then made the declaration to which I have referred.</text>

                <text>In case a different view should be taken on appeal, his Honour went on to
                  reach a precautionary conclusion that, in any event, he would have granted the
                  claimant leave to proceed pursuant to s 39(5)(c)(ii) of the Act. The nominal
                  defendant did not seek to contest that conclusion in this court. The possibility
                  that, in that event, the question sought to be argued might be hypothetical was
                  raised in argument by this court. However, as that possibility was not sought to
                  be relied on by the claimant, that she was, in any event, likely to be protected
                  by a costs order and that the question was common to at least one of the other
                  appeals heard with this one (<ci:cite searchtype="CASE-REF"

                <text>In my opinion the question identified by Mr Wilson SC is a question of general
                  importance and consequently one which, subject to any question of costs, in my
                  opinion justified the grant of leave. The argument before this court proceeded on
                  the assumption that leave was granted. The circumstances in which the above

                  vehicle accident on 6 September 2002. She alleges that she took action to avoid a
                  red utility motor vehicle which moved into her path while she was <page
                    count="559" reporter="mvr" text="39 MVR 548 at " subdoc="true"/> driving along
                  Ivory St towards the Story Bridge. As a result of taking such evasive action, her
                  vehicle was struck from behind by a silver motor vehicle which has remained
                  unidentified.</text>

                <text>The claimant consulted a solicitor on 14 November 2002 well within 3 months of
                  her accident. However, the solicitor failed to advise her that notice was required
                  to be given within the time stipulated by s 37(2)(a) of the Act, that is, within
                  3 months after the accident. In fact he advised her, wrongly, that such notice was
                  required to be given only within 1 month after she first consulted a solicitor
                  about the possibility of making a claim. <fnr fnrtoken="07-01442fn004-r"

                <text>A full explanation for the delay was given to the nominal defendant by new
                  solicitors for the claimant on 10 April 2003. In short, the explanation was that
                  the cause of the delay was the negligence of the claimant&#x2019;s former
                  solicitor. The explanation, which was provided by statutory declaration by the
                  claimant, showed, as the nominal defendant conceded, that the claimant&#x2019;s
                  own personal conduct was reasonably excusable. She consulted a solicitor within
                  time, followed him up, and did everything else that was reasonably required of
                  her. Thus the sole cause of the failure to give the notice within 3 months after
                  the date of the accident was the negligence of the solicitor. Hence the
                  identification of the sole question before this court in the above way.</text>

                <text>Two other considerations also influenced his Honour&#x2019;s conclusion. The
                  first was the change in the form of the legislation from s 4F(4)(b) of the Motor
                  Vehicles Insurance Act 1936 (Qld), to s 37 of the Act. The former required that
                  the failure to give notice within the period of 3 months &#x201C;was not
                  occasioned by any act or omission of the claimant or any person acting on his
                  behalf&#x201D;. As his Honour pointed out, it would have been easy enough to
                  repeat that form of words in the Act if it had been intended to encompass also any
                  act or omission of a person acting on behalf of a claimant.</text>

                <pnum count="11">[11]</pnum>
                <text>The other consideration which influenced his Honour was that, in respect of
                  somewhat analogous provisions, the view had been taken by courts that the fault of
                  his or her solicitor ought not, or ought not generally be ascribed to a claimant.

                  failure to give notice within the time fixed was due to &#x201C;reasonable
                  cause&#x201D;. In each case the claimant had left the matter in the hands of his
                  solicitor who had failed to give the notice within time. In the first of those
                  cases Scholl J thought that there was reasonable cause if the following question
                  were answered in the affirmative: &#x201C;whether the applicant has done what a
                  reasonable man might have been expected to do in leaving the matter to an
                  apparently competent agent, who has &#x2032;let him down&#x2019;&#x201D;. In the
                  second case the Full Court held that that was the correct test to apply.</text>

                <text>In my opinion that is the way in which s 37 should be construed. That is, the
                  claimant gives a reasonable excuse for the delay if the excuse is that, in
                  sufficient time, he or she entrusted the matter to a person who was reasonably
                  believed to be competent to do whatever was necessary. On the application of that
                  test to the facts here the claimant had on 10 April 2003 given to the nominal
                  defendant a reasonable excuse for the delay.</text>

                <text>It may be necessary to qualify that general proposition where, after a
                  claimant has entrusted the matter to his or her solicitor, there is something
                  which would cause a reasonable person in the position of the claimant to make
                  further inquiry or take other steps but it is unnecessary to consider any such
                  qualification here for the claimant here did all that could reasonably have been
                  expected of her.</text>

                <text>I should, for completeness, add that a question was raised during the course
                  of argument as to whether &#x201C;the delay&#x201D; in s 37(3) means the delay
                  from 6 December 2002, the expiry of the 3 month period specified in s 37(2)(a),
                  which was after the claimant had consulted her solicitors, or from 6 September
                  2002, the date of the motor vehicle accident. Although not conceding the point,
                  Mr Wilson SC, for the nominal defendant, did not argue strongly for the second
                  possibility. His apparent reluctance to do so was, in my opinion well founded.
                  There could have been no delay which required any excuse before 6 December <page

                  the whole of the period from 6 September 2002 may be relevant when considering the
                  exercise of discretion under s 39(5)(c). <fnr fnrtoken="07-01442fn009-r"

                <text>It is then necessary to consider whether, the claimant having within the
                  period specified in s 37(3) given a reasonable excuse for that delay, the court
                  should have exercised its discretion under s 39(5)(c) in favour of the claimant.
                  In my opinion it was appropriate to do so as his Honour did. Indeed it was not
                  contended by the nominal defendant that, on any discretionary basis, an order
                  should be refused and it conceded that it would have been appropriate to make an
                  order under s 39(5)(c)(ii).</text>

                <text>It remains to consider the form of order appropriate in those circumstances.
                  The order which his Honour made was a declaration that the claimant had given
                  reasonable excuse to the nominal defendant as required by s 37(3) of the Act in
                  respect of the failure by the claimant to give, within 3 months of the motor
                  vehicle accident on 6 September 2002, a written notice of her accident claim to
                  the nominal defendant. That was, it seems to me, a declaration made under
                  s 39(5)(c)(i) though it might have been better had his Honour stated the
                  declaration in terms of that provision.</text>

                <text>It is arguable that, the claimant having failed to give a notice within the
                  period specified in s 37(2)(a), that failure was incapable of being remedied
                  because, once that period had passed, that failure was incapable of being
                  remedied. I am inclined to think, however, that the intention of ss 37 and 39 was
                  that a court could declare that a claimant had remedied a failure to comply with
                  s 37(2)(a) by complying with s 37(3). <fnr fnrtoken="07-01442fn010-r"

                the 3 months provided for by s 37(2)(a). My understanding of submissions was that
                counsel for the nominal defendant primarily contended that the &#x201C;delay&#x201D;
                referred to the whole of the period from the date of the accident, but accepted that
                for purposes of the case in hand it was sufficient for him to concentrate on the
                period after the expiration of the 3 month period provided for by s 37(2)(a).</text>

              <text>In my view the &#x201C;delay&#x201D; for which a reasonable excuse must be
                provided is not limited to the period after the expiration of the 3 month period
                provided for by s 37(2)(a). If notice was given 1 day after the expiration of that 3
                month period then the notice was &#x201C;not given within the time fixed by this
                section&#x201D;, and explanation for the delay had to be given. In other words, the
                claimant would have to explain why notice was not given within the prescribed 3
                month period. The fact that notice was given only 1 day after the expiration of that
                period could provide a strong ground for the insurer (including the nominal
                defendant) being satisfied &#x201C;that the notice has been given as required under
                this division&#x201D; within s 39(1)(a)(i) and (5)(a)(i).</text>

                claimant may have acted with contemptuous disregard for the right of the insurer to
                be informed of the potential claim during the 3 month period, but then have taken
                reasonable steps after the expiration of that period to give notice. It would make a
                mockery of the legislative provisions for a court to ignore, or place no significant

              <text>Here, the claimant consulted a solicitor on 14 November 2002, well within the
                initial 3 month period. Failure to give notice during that 3 month period was due
                solely to the fact that that solicitor held a mistaken belief as to the relevant
                law. That remained the position until there was a change of solicitors in about
                February 2003. After the claimant changed solicitors a full explanation, both for

              <text>The remaining question is whether or not that amounted to &#x201C;reasonable
                excuse&#x201D;. Is it sufficient that the conduct of the claimant was reasonably
                excusable, or must the conduct of solicitors acting on the claimant&#x2019;s behalf
                also be reasonably excusable? In that regard it is significant, in my view, that the
                Act in s 37 departed significantly from s 4F(4)(b) of the Motor Vehicles Insurance
                Act 1936 (Qld), the provision which operated prior to 1994. In the 1936 Act a
                claimant had to show that the failure to give notice within the 3 month period
                &#x201C;was not occasioned by any act or omission of the claimant or any person
                acting on his behalf&#x201D;. The omission of the words &#x201C;or any person acting
                on his behalf&#x201D; was obviously deliberate and I am not persuaded that the
                language used in 1994 Act can be construed so as to include other persons acting on
                behalf of the claimant, such as a solicitor.</text>

              <text>The question will always be whether or not the claimant had &#x201C;reasonable
                excuse&#x201D; for the failure to comply with the statutory requirement. It may not
                always be sufficient simply to say that a solicitor was engaged during the relevant
                period. Where the solicitor appears to have knowledge of the relevant law, and gives
                specific advice (though incorrect) to the claimant, it would be difficult to
                conclude that the claimant acted unreasonably in relying on that advice. If it was
                obvious to a reasonable person in the position of the claimant that the solicitor
                retained was not acting appropriately, then it may well be that it would not be
                sufficient for the claimant to explain away the failure to comply with the statutory
                requirement by saying a solicitor was retained. Here it is obvious that the claimant
                was misled by incorrect advice given by the initial solicitor, and in consequence
                she had reasonable excuse for the failure to comply with the requirements of the
                Act.</text>

                uncontroversial there is no need for me to repeat them. The case is one where notice
                of the motor vehicle accident claim was not given within the 3 month period referred
                to in s 37(2)(a) of the Act but was given, together with an excuse for not doing so,

              <text>What follows is my view of the operation of s 37. It will, of course, always be
                necessary to pay close attention to the facts of individual cases. What appears
                  <page count="564" reporter="mvr" text="39 MVR 548 at " subdoc="true"/> in the
                following paragraphs is not intended to be, nor could it be, a comprehensive
                statement that can be mechanically applied to resolve every case. The generality of
                the discussion dictates this; but what is said is intended to indicate what are, in
                my view, the kinds of factors that may influence decisions. They are also, of
                course, not necessarily exhaustive.</text>

              <text>Under s 37(1) of the Act, before bringing an action for damages for personal
                injury arising out of the motor vehicle accident, a claimant must give written
                notice of the accident to the insurer containing certain information required under
                a regulation. Under s 37(2), if the notice was to be given to the nominal defendant
                because the motor vehicle could not be identified it must be given within 3 months
                after the accident. Under s 37(3), if notice of a motor vehicle accident claim was
                not given within the period of 3 months (in the case of the nominal defendant) the
                obligation to give the notice continued and a reasonable excuse for the delay had to
                be given in the notice or by separate notice. If the motor vehicle could not be
                identified and the notice was not given to the nominal defendant within 9 months
                after the motor vehicle accident, a claim against the nominal defendant was
                barred.</text>

            <p>
              <pnum count="33">[33]</pnum>
              <text>Section 39(8) provides that if a claim against the nominal defendant is barred
                because the claim relates to personal injury caused by, through or in connection
                with a motor vehicle that can not be identified, and the claimant failed to give
                notice of the claim in accordance with Div 3 of Pt 4 of the Act within 9 months
                after the motor vehicle accident, the nominal defendant cannot waive compliance with
                the requirement to give notice within the time allowed by Div 3. Nor can the court
                give leave to bring a proceeding in a court despite the noncompliance: s 39(8). The
                last mentioned concept relates back to s 39(5)(c)(ii) which allows the court on
                application by the claimant to authorise further proceedings based on the claim
                despite noncompliance with Div 3. In my opinion the provisions of s 37(3) require
                both the notice and a reasonable excuse for the delay in giving the notice to be
                given before 9 months have elapsed from the date of the accident. In my opinion it
                is not sufficient compliance with that provision if a notice in the required form is
                given within the 9 month period but the excuse for the delay is not given until
                after the 9 month period has elapsed. If a determination by the court whether an
                excuse given within 9 months is a reasonable one has not been made within that
                period, it would not conflict with s 39(8) if a determination was made after
                9 months had elapsed since the excuse has been given within time. Only the question
                whether it was reasonable needed to be established.</text>

              <text>&#x201C;A reasonable excuse for the delay&#x201D; implies the existence of
                circumstances explaining why notice was not given to the nominal defendant until
                more than 3 months had elapsed from the date of the accident. In referring to the
                &#x201C;delay&#x201D;, the provision is referring to the state of affairs which has
                contributed to the notice not being given until the period of 3 months + x months
                has elapsed, not only x months. Setting a period of 3 months for giving notice
                without any need to account for the claimant&#x2019;s actions within that period,
                provided the notice is given within that period, represents a policy determination
                that 3 months strikes a balance between the interests of the claimant and the
                nominal defendant. In my view the intention of prescribing the brief period for
                giving notice is to allow the nominal defendant to make its own inquiries into the
                accident at the earliest opportunity to assist it to ensure that claims are bona
                fide and, perhaps more <page count="565" reporter="mvr" text="39 MVR 548 at "
                  subdoc="true"/> infrequently, to increase its chances of identifying the other
                vehicle. In my opinion focusing only on the period after 3 months has elapsed is too
                narrow an approach.</text>

              <text>While a claimant has 3 months in which to make a claim, there is no reason why,
                if notice is not given within that period, the claimant&#x2019;s actions within the
                whole of the period prior to notice being given are not relevant matters of inquiry.
                There is no reason why, in this particular statutory context, the first 3 month
                period should be free from scrutiny.</text>

              <text>In my view, the conduct of the person who wishes to make the claim should be the
                primary focus of the inquiry. Where a person appreciated that there may be some
                requirements governing the making of a claim but did not take steps that should
                reasonably be taken to ascertain what the requirements of the law were, that factor,
                throughout the first 3 months and subsequently until the notice was given, would be
                a legitimate area of inquiry.</text>

              <text>Taking advice from a properly qualified person would be the obvious way of
                ascertaining what had to be done. If a person took advice from a solicitor and gave
                instructions to act to advance the claim, and the solicitor did not do so, it would
                be harsh to attribute failure to give notice in a timely way to the claimant. The

                conjunction with the construction issue referred to in the next paragraph. But if,
                for example, it was alleged that instructions had been given to progress the claim
                but it appeared that the claimant had failed to respond to requests by the solicitor
                to take appropriate steps or provide information for the purpose of enabling the
                claim to be advanced, it would in my view be legitimate to take that into account in
                deciding whether reasonable excuse had been given.</text>

              <text>In my view the failure to reproduce the provisions in s 4F(4)(b) of the Motor
                Vehicles Insurance Act 1936 (Qld) which was in operation until 1994 is also a cogent
                reason for thinking that, as a general proposition, negligence on the part of a
                solicitor should not be attributed to the claimant. For this reason, if the client
                had not been guilty of default of the kind recently mentioned and entrusted the
                carriage of the claim to the solicitor and the solicitor negligently failed to
                advance it in a timely way, the likelihood that the excuse advanced should
                ordinarily be accepted as a reasonable excuse. If the solicitor gave advice that was
                demonstrably wrong but there was no reason for the claimant to believe that it was
                incorrect advice, a claimant acting on that advice would ordinarily have a
                reasonable excuse. A claimant would be in a particularly strong position if he or
                she had done properly what was required of him or her by the solicitor or, not
                having been asked to do anything themselves, inquired about the progress of the
                matter from time to time.</text>

              <text>In cases where the solicitor&#x2019;s default was the cause of the failure to
                give the notice in a timely way, the client would ordinarily have a viable action
                against the solicitor. However, the existence of that possible basis of liability is
                not relevant in deciding the question of whether, in a particular case, a reasonable
                excuse for the delay has been given. In the absence of a very clear legislative
                intention to cost shift by transferring liability from the nominal defendant to the
                insurer of the solicitor in cases where the claimant may have a right of action
                against the solicitor, there is no compelling reason to infer that the prospective
                  <page count="566" reporter="mvr" text="39 MVR 548 at " subdoc="true"/> claimant
                was intended to be limited to taking proceedings against the solicitor for negligent
                action or inaction that is wholly or substantially the fault of the

                  contemporaneously with these reasons) whether in deciding whether a reasonable
                  excuse has been given, for the purposes of s 37(3) of the Act, it is necessary to
                  consider only whether the claimant&#x2019;s own personal actions were reasonably
                  excusable in the light of what occurred or whether, in circumstances where the
                  claimant retained a solicitor in connection with the giving of the notice, it is
                  also necessary for the actions of the solicitor, in so far as they contributed to
                  the delay, to be reasonably excused.</text>

              <p>
                <pnum count="4">[4]</pnum>
                <text>The second point is whether any such reasonable excuse must be given within
                  the period of 9 months specified in s 37(3) of the Act. The learned primary judge
                  expressed the view that it did not need to be given within that period; hence the
                  condition imposed in para (1)(a) of the above order.</text>

                <text>A third question also arises, albeit not from the terms of the appeal or
                  cross-appeal. That is whether, if reasonable excuse must be given within 9 months
                  of the motor vehicle accident, this court can nevertheless thereafter authorise
                  further proceedings based on the claim despite that non-compliance.</text>

                <text>The relevant facts are as follows. The claimant alleges that he was injured on
                  18 February 2002 when he says he was forced to take evasive action so that the bus
                  which he was driving in the course of his employment avoided colliding with a
                  vehicle at the intersection of Ann and George Sts, Brisbane. There was no
                  collision and the other vehicle allegedly involved remains unidentified. There do
                    <page count="567" reporter="mvr" text="39 MVR 548 at " subdoc="true"/> not
                  appear to have been any witnesses. The claimant claims to have suffered an injury
                  to his left shoulder. He completed a workers&#x2019; compensation claim in respect
                  of such injury on 19 February.</text>
              </p>
              <p>
                <pnum count="7">[7]</pnum>
                <text>On 23 May 2002 the claimant first consulted a solicitor, Mr Bentley of his
                  present solicitors. He saw Mr Bentley for a short consultation after working hours
                  on that day. His purpose was to discuss the cessation of his WorkCover benefits.
                  However, he did tell Mr Bentley on that occasion that he injured his shoulder
                  during an incident which occurred while driving his bus, that there were no
                  witnesses as the bus was empty and that the offending vehicle had left the scene.
                  He said that the incident did not involve a collision with any other vehicle, that
                  accordingly there were no marks on the bus and that in consequence there was some
                  scepticism about the incident at his work place.</text>

                <text>It is of some significance, it seems to me, that Mr Bentley provided the
                  claimant with a form of notice under s 37 of the Act to fill out, and says that he
                  told him to fill it out as best he could so that when he saw one of the lawyers in
                  the firm who specialised in personal injuries they would have all the relevant
                  information. It is also relevant that the notice, signed by the claimant and
                  received by the nominal defendant only on 11 July 2002, was signed by the claimant
                  on 23 May 2002 and states that his first consultation with the solicitors was on
                  22 May 2002. This may have been a telephone conversation, to which Mr Bentley
                  refers, in which the meeting on 23 May was arranged. The learned primary judge
                  held, rightly in my opinion, that the possibility of a claim against the nominal
                  defendant was discussed at that meeting.</text>

                <text>It appears from his Honour&#x2019;s judgment that the claimant, and perhaps
                  some other witnesses, gave oral evidence in this application but none of that was
                  before this court. His Honour expressed some reservations about the reliability of
                  the claimant&#x2019;s evidence and I shall return to that later. He did not
                  express any opinion about the reliability of the evidence of Mr Bentley or of that
                  of Ms Leszczuk, a paralegal. For the reason just mentioned, this court is not
                  aware whether either gave oral evidence. However, his Honour did express concern
                  about the possibility of conflict of interest between the claimant and the
                  solicitors, presumably because of the likelihood, as his Honour found, that some
                  of the delay was caused by their incompetence. This is of relevance in the
                  assessment of the claimant&#x2019;s conduct.</text>

                <text>It seems plain that it was the claimant&#x2019;s intention on 23 May to retain
                  those solicitors generally in respect of his injury and they sent him various
                  documents including a retainer agreement on 6 June. The claimant attended at those
                  solicitors&#x2019; office on 18 June when Mr Bentley discussed with him the
                  retainer agreement and he signed it. There was a further consultation with
                  Mr Bentley on 26 June in which the latter explained the process in pursuing a
                  WorkCover claim.</text>

                <text>During June the solicitors&#x2019; firm was experiencing staff problems. Two
                  employed solicitors apparently left. It also seems that both Mr Bentley, an
                  employed solicitor Ms Sulman, and Ms Leszczuk who was appointed to handle his
                  matter, were mistaken as to the time within which a notice was required to be
                  given under s 37(2)(a). The claimant was calling constantly during this period but
                  it appears that very little if any attention was given to his matter. It was not
                  until 11 July 2002 that the solicitors gave to the nominal defendant the written
                  notice of his motor vehicle accident claim in purported compliance with s 37 of
                  the Act.</text>

                <text>By the time this notice was given nearly 5 months had expired since the
                  alleged accident. However, neither in the notice or concurrently with it did the
                  claimant give any excuse for the delay as required by s 37(3). The nominal
                  defendant wrote to the claimant&#x2019;s solicitors on 16 July notifying them of
                  that omission.</text>

                <pnum count="15">[15]</pnum>
                <text>The first attempt to provide an excuse for the delay is contained in the
                  solicitors&#x2019; letter to the nominal defendant of 15 August. It said:</text>
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  <text>Due to a changeover in staff, it is unclear how the s 37 Notice came to be
                    given outside the prescribed time limit.</text>
                </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                <text>Of course that provided no excuse at all or even an explanation for the delay.
                  The delay from 18&#x2013;23 May 2002 when the claimant first consulted his
                  solicitor was not caused by anyone other than the claimant himself. But because it
                  was short, Mr Wilson SC for the nominal defendant was able to suggest, as the only
                  reason <page count="569" reporter="mvr" text="39 MVR 548 at " subdoc="true"/> why,
                  if a notice had been given on 23 May 2002, an order would not then have been made
                  pursuant to s 39(5)(c)(ii) authorising further proceedings based on the claim
                  despite the non-compliance with s 37(2)(a), that the claimant had given
                  inconsistent explanations for that delay.</text>

                <text>As to the delay after 23 May, the above quoted statement, it seems to me,
                  conceals the real reason &#x2014; the misunderstanding by Mr Bentley, whose client
                  the claimant believed himself to be, his employed solicitor Ms Sulman and his
                  paralegal Ms Leszczuk, as to the notice requirements under the Act in respect of a
                  claim against the nominal defendant. It is necessary to view the claimant&#x2019;s

                <text>Three points may be made about these statutory declarations. The first is that
                  it seems that the claimant is a Dutch migrant who says he has little knowledge of
                  written English. Second the claimant&#x2019;s misapprehensions as to the notice
                  requirements expressed in the statutory declarations appear to have been the same
                  misapprehension as those under which Mr Bentley and his employees were suffering.
                  And third, obviously, the solicitors drafted each of the statutory
                  declarations.</text>

                <text>His Honour found the claimant&#x2019;s evidence unsatisfactory. He thought it
                  vague and at times evasive. His Honour said that he did not mean by this that he
                  was a wholly unreliable witness; simply that his evidence on this point, the
                  explanation for the delay, was unsatisfactory. There is no reason to doubt the
                  correctness of his Honour&#x2019;s conclusion and I would accept it. But it
                  appears that those in the solicitor&#x2019;s firm were also relying for the law,
                  not on the terms of s 37, but on the nominal defendant&#x2019;s website. It is
                  unnecessary to consider whether or not that website accurately stated the law. It
                  is plain that the solicitors misapprehended the law and it is, to say the least, a
                  remarkable coincidence that <page count="570" reporter="mvr" text="39 MVR 548 at "
                    subdoc="true"/> their misapprehension was the same as that which the claimant
                  swore were his and that, like that of the claimant&#x2019;s, it was said to
                  emanate from the nominal defendant&#x2019;s website.</text>

                <text>His Honour concluded that nothing said by the solicitors or in the above
                  statutory declarations was a reasonable excuse for the delay from
                  18&#x2013;11 July 2002. I agree with that conclusion.</text>

                <text>His Honour then appears to have concluded, or at least his findings were
                  consistent with the conclusion that the failure to give a reasonable excuse for
                  the delay from 23 May was the fault of the solicitor. His Honour&#x2019;s findings
                  in that respect were:</text>

              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  <text>The delay from 23 May until 10 July is unexplained, but may be due to

                    responsibility for failing properly to lodge the notice of reasonable excuse.
                    Nonetheless it seems to me more likely than not that it was their neglect which

                  Honour was correct in concluding that the delay which occurred after 23 May 2002
                  when the claimant first consulted his solicitor, cannot be attributed to the
                  claimant. Not only did he leave in the hands of his solicitor the question of any
                  claim which he might have in respect of his injury, but he followed that up with
                  that solicitor and another person in the firm to whom the solicitor referred him.
                  Given the claimant&#x2019;s limited education and sophistication I think that from
                  23 May 2002 he acted reasonably in leaving in the hands of his solicitor the doing
                  of whatever was reasonably necessary to pursue a claim in respect of his injury;
                  and that includes a claim against the nominal defendant. The claimant was
                  therefore responsible only for the delay from 18&#x2013;23 May 2002, a period of
                  5 days. He would have given a reasonable excuse for his delay in giving notice of
                  claim after 23 May by saying, as was the case, that he had on that day entrusted
                  the matter to his solicitors.</text>

                <text>By the time the matter came on before his Honour the claimant had, of course,
                  given a form of notice of his claim, but not a reasonable excuse for delay, on
                  11 July 2002. The application before his Honour was filed on 18 November 2002 and
                  heard by him on 13 December 2002. His Honour gave judgment on 22 April 2003. In
                  order to determine what were the consequences, if any, of that sequence of events,
                  in particular whether it had the effect that the claimant could no longer pursue
                  his claim against the nominal defendant, it is necessary to consider the meaning
                  and application to the facts of this case, as I have stated them, of ss 37, 39
                  and 57 of the Act.</text>

                <text>I have already set out the relevant provisions of ss 37 and 39. Section 57

                <text>The learned primary judge was of opinion that &#x201C;notice&#x201D; where it
                  last appears in s 37(3), means only the notice of motor vehicle accident claim
                  given under that section whether or not it contains a reasonable excuse.
                  Consequently his Honour held that, even though the notice of claim must be given
                  within 9 months a reasonable excuse for delay may be given at any time.</text>

                <pnum count="27">[27]</pnum>
                <text>There are, in my opinion, a number of difficulties in that interpretation
                  although I accept that it is open on the literal meaning of the section. In the
                  first place it seems odd that if the reasonable excuse happens to be given in the
                  notice, that notice containing the reasonable excuse must be given within
                  9 months, but if the claimant chooses to give no explanation in the notice or an
                  unreasonable one, he or she has, prima facie, an unlimited time within which to
                  give a notice containing a reasonable excuse.</text>

              <p>
                <pnum count="28">[28]</pnum>
                <text>Second, it seems inconsistent with the mandatory requirement that a notice
                  giving a reasonable excuse must be given that, prima facie, it can be given at any
                  time in the future; it may be questioned whether that would be consistent with any
                  meaningful obligation.</text>

                <pnum count="29">[29]</pnum>
                <text>Third, such an interpretation appears inconsistent with what appears to have
                  been the purpose of the amendment made in 2000 to s 37 permitting reasonable
                  excuse to be given otherwise than contained in the notice of claim, namely that
                  the requirement in the former s 37(4) that the notice, when given,
                  &#x201C;contain&#x201D; an explanation for the delay, excluded a reasonable excuse
                  given at the same time as the notice of claim but in a separate document except
                  where that document in some way formed part of the notice of claim; to avoid the
                  possibility that compliance with that provision might depend on whether it was
                  &#x201C;attached by a paper clip rather than by means of a staple&#x201D;. <fnr

                <text>And fourth, to construe s 37(3) in such a way as to permit reasonable excuse
                  to be given even after the expiry of the period of limitation appears to be
                  inconsistent with the stated object of the speedy resolution of disputes, <fnr

                  last appears in that section means the notice of claim where the reasonable excuse
                  is given in the notice or the notice of claim and the separate notice of
                  reasonable excuse where the reasonable excuse is given in a separate

                <text>It is plain on the above facts that, on the above interpretation of s 37(3),

                <text>An application for leave to bring a proceeding based on the motor vehicle

                  specified in s 37(3) because that application was filed on the last day of that
                  period. <fnr fnrtoken="07-01442fn016-r" fntoken="07-01442fn016">16</fnr> However,

                  Division within 9 months after the motor vehicle accident, the court may not
                  thereafter give leave to bring a proceeding in a court despite the non-compliance.
                  Prima facie, therefore, notwithstanding that the application was made before the
                  expiry of the 9 month period, the court cannot, thereafter, give leave pursuant to

                <text>Whether s 57(1) applies to permit a contrary result depends on whether, on the
                  correct construction of that provision, the period of 9 months specified in
                  ss 37(3) and 39(8) is a &#x201C;period of limitation applying to the claim&#x201D;
                  against the nominal defendant. To answer that question affirmatively would give

                <text>There is, in the Act, an essential difference between an action against an
                  owner of a motor vehicle for damages for personal injury arising out of a motor
                  vehicle accident and a claim of a similar kind against the nominal defendant. In
                  the first case, s 52(1) provides that if an action is brought in a court for
                  damages for personal injury arising out of a motor vehicle accident, the action
                  must be brought against the insured person and the insurer as joint defendants.
                  The Act assumes the existence of such a cause of action and mandates against whom
                  the action based on that cause of action must be brought. The cause of action
                  remains one at common law though substantially modified by the Act. The limitation
                  period applying to such an action is that contained in s 11 7 of the Limitation of
                  Actions Act 1974 (Qld). <fnr fnrtoken="07-01442fn017-r" fntoken="07-01442fn017"

                  <text>&#x2026; It may be that there is a distinction between Statutes of
                    Limitation, properly so called, which operate to prevent the enforcement of
                    rights of action independently existing, and limitation provisions annexed by a
                    statute to a right newly created by it. In the latter case the limitation does
                    not bar an existing cause of action. It imposes a condition which is of the
                    essence of a new right &#x2026;</text>

                <p>
                  <text>&#x2026; It seems that, under the common law system of pleading, when a
                    limitation is annexed by a particular statute to a right it creates, the
                    plaintiff should allege in his declaration that the action was brought within
                    time. On the other hand it is for the defendant to plead the Statute of
                    Limitations as a defence to an action on a common law cause of action, as if he
                    does not it is assumed that he intends to waive it &#x2026;</text>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <text>&#x2026; However, when issue is joined on a plea of the Statute, the burden
                    of proving that the action is within time is on the plaintiff &#x2026;</text>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <text>&#x2026; And, even when a time limit is imposed by the statute that creates
                    a new cause of action or right, it may be so expressed that it is regarded as
                    having a purely procedural character, as a condition of the remedy rather than
                    an element in the right; and in such cases it can, it seems, be waived, either
                    expressly or in some cases by estoppel &#x2026;</text>

                  <text>A distinction is generally drawn between those statutes which are said to
                    take away the remedy available to a party without touching that party&#x2019;s
                    underlying right and those statutes or limitation provisions which expressly or

                <p>
                  <text>Statutes of limitation which operate to prevent the enforcement of
                    independently existing rights of action, whether known at common law or, in some
                    circumstances, created by statute, are typically described as denying a remedy
                    while not destroying or extinguishing an underlying right &#x2026;</text>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <text>Not all statutes of limitation, however, operate simply to deny a party a
                    remedy while leaving a right in existence. Limitation provisions which can be
                    seen as incidents of rights created, whether by the same or another related
                    statute, have been typically construed as extinguishing those rights after the
                    effluxion of the nominated period of time. As Windeyer J put it in <ci:cite
                      searchtype="CASE-REF"><ci:content><citefragment searchtype="CASE-NAME-REF"

                    limitation provisions, &#x201C;the limitation does not bar an existing cause of
                    action, it imposes a condition which is of the essence of a new

                    the right of a person having a cause of action. In other cases, the conclusion
                    that that limitation provision operates to extinguish a right will turn on the
                    process of statutory construction.</text>

                <text>Here both the creation of the right to sue the nominal defendant and the
                  barring of the right or any claim based on that right are contained in the same
                  Act. There are, moreover, two other indications that, so far as claims against the
                  nominal defendant are concerned, it was the intention of the Act to terminate the
                  right to make any such claim if notice is not given within 9 months after the
                  motor vehicle accident.</text>

                <pnum count="40">[40]</pnum>
                <text>The first of these is that s 37(3), in terms, bars not just the action <fnr
                    fnrtoken="07-01442fn025-r" fntoken="07-01442fn025">25</fnr> but the claim on
                  which it is based. And the second, even stronger indication, is that, as mentioned
                  earlier, <fnr fnrtoken="07-01442fn026-r" fntoken="07-01442fn026">26</fnr> s 39(8)
                  provides that, unless such notice is given within 9 months after the motor vehicle
                  accident, the nominal defendant cannot waive compliance with the requirement to
                  give notice within that time, nor can the court give leave to bring a proceeding
                  in a court despite the non-compliance. These provisions appear to be intended not
                  merely to bar an existing right of action but to impose a condition which is of
                  the essence of the right, created by the Act, to <page count="574" reporter="mvr"
                    text="39 MVR 548 at " subdoc="true"/> sue the Nominal Defendant. Reading s 37(3)
                  with ss 39(5) and 39(8) that alternative condition, it seems to me, is that a
                  notice is given within 9 months of the motor vehicle accident, or that, within
                  that period, compliance with the requirement for giving such notice is waived or
                  the court gives leave to bring a proceeding despite the non-compliance. It follows
                  that s 57(1), in my opinion, has no application.</text>

                <text>None of these alternative conditions were complied with in the present case.
                  It follows that, in my opinion, his Honour could not have made an order,
                  conditional or otherwise, when he did so and this court cannot make any such
                  order. However, as this was not argued by the nominal defendant, either before the
                  learned primary judge or this court &#x2014; indeed the contrary was conceded
                  &#x2014; I would not be inclined to make any order as to costs.</text>

              <text>The incident upon which the claim is based allegedly happened on 18 February
                2002. The 3 month period for giving notice of claim expired on 18 May 2002. The
                notice of claim, not accompanied by any excuse for the delay was given on 11 July
                2002.</text>

              <text>The excuses relied on were given on 15 August 2002, 11 September 2002 and
                23 October 2002. The first was not really an excuse except to the extent that it
                implied default of the solicitors. The second and third, while not wholly <page

                suggested that the appellant was aware that there were time limits but was
                mis-informed about them by friends and relations and subsequently by his

              <text>On 18 November 2002 an originating application seeking, in the alternative, an
                order that the excuse provided was reasonable within the meaning of s 37(3) of the
                Act or that the applicant be granted leave to file proceedings notwithstanding
                non-compliance with the Act was filed. The first aspect of the application was
                disposed of by a finding of fact by the learned trial judge that reasonable excuse
                had not been given by the claimant. The claimant&#x2019;s credibility was a factor
                in the finding. The order actually made is set out in [1] of Davies JA reasons for
                judgment.</text>

                finding on the first ground in the application was erroneous, but no reason was
                demonstrated why it should be disturbed. There was an appeal by the nominal
                defendant against the order on a number of grounds.</text>

              <text>The present appeal is one which turns on the power of the court to authorise
                further proceedings, based on a claim despite non-compliance, after a period of
                9 months has elapsed from the accident. The bar imposed by s 39(8) applies to cases
                where &#x201C;notice&#x201D;, which includes reasonable excuse, has not been given.
                In a case where no such &#x201C;notice&#x201D; has been given and s 39(5)(c)(ii) is
                relied on, the order must be made within 9 months. That is to be distinguished from
                the situation where s 39(5)(c)(i) is relied on in a case where the dispute is
                whether an excuse given is reasonable. In such a case the quality of the excuse as
                reasonable or not reasonable has become fixed at the time at which it was given. A
                determination that the excuse given within time is reasonable may be made outside
                the period of 9 months.</text>

            <text>[ <emph typestyle="bf">Note.</emph> The role of the solicitors in two of these
